# Exercise 1: Add types to JavaScript code

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and allows you to annotate your code with extra type information. This is useful for improving the readability of your code and for ensuring that your code is type-safe. Let's add some type annotations to the JavaScript code in this exercise directory.

## Goals

* Rename every JavaScript file to end with `.ts`
* Add missing TypeScript syntax by following the compile errors
* Run the unit tests to check for additional problems and fix them
* Encapsulate public field access in classes

## Stretch goals

* Add additional unit tests to improve test coverage
* Improve the implementation of `hash.ts` using your IDEs TypeScript refactoring capabilities
